# Discovery System

the concept of a discovery system in ai is a program that is able to find out new truths either from science or maths or just experimental or observational data in general. I think focussing on the maths part makes more sense than finding underlying data. It is basically a robot mathematician. 

hopefully because this program is made of maths itself it gains the ability to analyse itself and ipmrove upon it self but who knows.

I think randomness is the best model of human intelligence. a true ai must be able to modify itself in a way outside of the limits of the creator. 

I think im going to start with an integral discoverer
